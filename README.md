Truffle Flattener concats solidity files from Truffle and Buidler projects 
with all of their dependencies.

This tool helps you to verify contracts developed with Truffle and Buidler 
on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io), or debugging them on
[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), by merging your files and their
dependencies in the right order.

If you are still using Truffle, we recommend you try [Buidler](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler), 
our Ethereum development environment, which is much faster and flexible.

# Installation

`npm install truffle-flattener -g`

# Usage

Just install it with npm in your truffle project and run
`truffle-flattener <solidity-files>`.

# Limitations

Aliased imports (eg: `import {symbol1 as alias, symbol2} from "filename";`) are
not supported by `truffle-flattener`.
